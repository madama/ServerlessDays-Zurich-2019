        "title": "Running Web Platform with no servers: Serverless in production",
        "description": "Serverless is a new technology, which promises faster business value delivery, reduced costs and simplified operations. As with every new technology, there is a promise of an added value on one side and the risk on another side. Being an early adopter can give your company advantage over your competitors, but does the serverless really full-fills its promise? What challenges will you encounter on your way to the first production-ready serverless microservices? I will try to provide you with an answer to this questions based on lessons we learned when implementing our first 100% serverless microservices, including deployment, code organisation, monitoring, logging, security and many other aspects which have to be approached in a different way in the new brave world of serverless.",
        "about": "Passionate about software development with focus on bringing the maximum value to the business with least effort. After many years as a freelance software developer working on different projects varying in size and domain, making his experience in small startup (which failed), big enterprises as BMW being at leadership positions there and running his own software-engineering company, he finally found his home at Homegate.ch as Technical Lead and accepted the challenged, together with the great team at Homegate.ch to reengineer the platform from monolith heritage system operated on ‘on-premise’ to serverless micro-services running on AWS, making it the clear number one real estate platform in Switzerland.  Family guy,  proud father of three, fan of triathlon and boxing. Loving mountains and pure nature, addicted to bicycling, Tech-Blogs and software-engineering staff."

        "description": "Serverless is all the rage these days, but how did we get here and why should businesses and developer care about serverless? In this talk, we will hear about Yan's journey from running on-prem servers to EC2, to containers, and finally to serverless. We will hear about the evolution of development practices and debunk some common misconceptions about serverless. We'll also get a glimpse of how we can build new kinds of businesses on top of serverless, and why FinDev might be an even bigger game changer for businesses than DevOps.",
        "about": "Yan is an experienced engineer who has run production workload at scale in AWS for nearly 10 years. He has been an architect and principal engineer with a variety of industries ranging from banking, e-commerce, sports streaming to mobile gaming.

        "description": "Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on “cloud” services (knows as Backend as a Service) or on custom code that’s run in ephemeral runtime (Function as a Service or “FaaS”).<br/>To application developers, “serverless” mean app where some certain logic of it is still written by the developer but unlike traditional architectures or microservices is run in stateless compute runtime that is event-triggered, may only last for one invocation, and fully managed by a cloud. Serverless helps developers to transfer responsibility for keeping their apps up and running as well as scaling out their workload capacity without involving DevOps/Ops as we got used to.<br/>In this talk, we will go through two successful projects Oracle Function and Fn Project, it’s origin, features. etc. We will go into details regarding functions development process, distribution and go a little into technical details like performance, scaling.",

        "description": "Are you confused when scheduled Lambdas execute twice, SNS messages trigger an invocation three times, your handmade S3 inventory is out of sync because events occurred twice? Bad news: Sooner or later, your Lambda function executes multiple times. You have to prepare yourself! The reasons are system failures, retries on errors, and event sources that guarantee at-least-once delivery (e.g., CloudWatch Events, SNS, …). In this talk, you learn why Lambda functions might execute twice and what you can do about it focusing on Lambda, DynamoDB, and Kinesis Data Streams.",

        "description": "<i>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”</i> — Arthur C Clarke<br/>Well, machine learning can look like magic, but you don't need to be a data scientist or an ML researcher to develop with ML.<br/>So, what about making your solution smarter without any knowledge in AI? With pre-trained models and a few lines of code, machine learning APIs can analyze your data. Moreover, AutoML techniques can now help in getting even more specific insights tailored to your needs.",
